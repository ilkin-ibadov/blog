        title: "How to Build a Productive Morning Routine",
        body: `
          <p>
            A productive day starts with a purposeful morning. Your morning routine sets the tone 
            for everything that follows — mentally, emotionally, and physically. But it's not about 
            waking up at 5 AM. It's about creating habits that work for *you*.
          </p>
      
          <br/>
      
          <p>
            Start small. Even just 15 minutes of quiet time, stretching, or writing can make a huge difference. 
            Avoid checking your phone first thing — instead, focus on your breath, your body, and your intentions 
            for the day. Journaling or reading something inspiring can also help create mental clarity.
          </p>
      
          <br/>
      
          <h3>Key Tips for a Solid Morning Routine</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Wake up at a consistent time</li>
            <li>Drink a full glass of water</li>
            <li>Move your body (walk, stretch, or work out)</li>
            <li>Take 5–10 minutes for reflection or planning</li>
            <li>Limit digital distractions</li>
          </ul>
      
          <br/>
      
          <p>
            The secret? Consistency. A good morning isn’t about perfection, it’s about repetition. 
            Build a routine that fits your life and watch how it transforms your mindset.
          </p>
